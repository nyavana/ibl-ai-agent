# IBL Analyze

## Use this skill when
- The user asks an IBL scientific question requiring quantitative analysis.
- You need metric semantics, operator selection, QC, or statistical-unit guidance.

## Required first step
Apply the `AGENTS.md` scientific workflow before choosing metrics or scaling up. This skill adds IBL-specific analysis details; it does not replace the metric-validation gate.

## Default analysis policy
1. Define the scientific quantity, metric, row grain, event/window, QC scope, denominators, and independent statistical unit.
2. Classify each metric as direct, operationalized, or proxy.
3. Do not map natural-language terms directly onto convenient stored columns.
4. Use stored derived features only within their documented event/window/statistic/denominator definition.
5. Validate custom, ambiguous, proxy, event-aligned, trial-aligned, neural, behavioral, or state metrics with source-to-metric diagnostic plots before downstream analysis unless explicitly skipped.
6. Consult applicable caveats and choose at least one adversarial metric check when validating a metric.
7. Prefer local BWM tables and shards when their schema covers the question.
8. Use `brainbox` operators when they match the metric semantics; otherwise use question-specific NumPy/Pandas/SciPy code and state why.
9. Normalize region labels to one declared atlas mapping before grouping.
10. Use deterministic seeds for stochastic analysis.

## Stored derived feature rule
When using a stored derived feature:
- load and report event name, window specification, statistic, sign convention, and denominator fields when available;
- state whether the feature measures peak, baseline, onset, mean, modulation, or another statistic;
- filter to responsive/analyzable units when the scientific question implies a response property rather than all units;
- do not overinterpret the feature beyond its documented definition.

## BWM routing note
For Brain Wide Map questions, read `../ibl-load/references/bwm_runtime_policy.md` first and `references/bwm_analysis_patterns.md` second. Do not restate or bypass BWM loading policy here.
